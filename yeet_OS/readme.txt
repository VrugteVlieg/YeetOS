This is a 16-bit OS that I wrote as a project in a holiday.
It really doesnt do much, navigate the keyboard with wasd and press enter to make the character appear in the output section, backspace will erase.
If you erase past the start of the output section(which can happen just roll with it) you can get back by just placing spaces to get back
